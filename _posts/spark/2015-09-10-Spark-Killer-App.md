Since becoming a top-level Apache project in 2014, Apache Spark has seen
tremendous adoption. In this presentation for the
[Baltimore Scala Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Scala/events/224636405/)
I provided a high level overview of the Spark ecosystem and explored some of
the Scala API through use cases.

Many thanks to Andrew Felix for organizing the meetup and pizza, Paris @ AOL
for a fantastic space and support. Thanks to everyone who made it out!
