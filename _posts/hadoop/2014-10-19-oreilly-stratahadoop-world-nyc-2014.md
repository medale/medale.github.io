[O'Reilly's Strata/Hadoop World NYC 2014 Conference](http://strataconf.com/stratany2014/), just like its predecessors, 
was a good learning and networking opportunity. Even at its new location, the NYC Javits Center,
the conference sold out with over 5,500 attendees. So it is now a big conference.

With all that money going into big data, lots of vendors and lots of interest
that was probably inevitable. One downside of such a big conference was that 
even some of the non-sponsored talks had become very "pitchy", with speakers 
touting their products. That should be confined to sponsored talks or the vendor 
expo. I don't mind a slide or two on company affiliation but a product walk through
or demo is not how I want to spend valuable conference learning time.

Still some excellent technical talks on Hadoop YARN and HBase! 

I had looked very much forward to the Spark tutorial. The morning overview was excellent.
Unfortunately, the afternoon hands-on session was very rushed as the
Databricks presenters tried to cram a tutorial created for a full day into
half a day. Still good material but would have benefited from extra time. 

Fortunately, Databricks provided all the material on a USB stick so we can now cover 
that material more at our leisure. Spark was definitely a hot topic and even
at Strata/Hadoop should have had some more sessions. Looking forward to trying
this out in depth.
