# Continuous Self Improvement For Software Developers

Just like the rest of the world, the software world is rapidly changing. To stay 
relevant we have to change with it. We have to expand our knowledge and practices
to learn from promising changes and then apply them in our daily development to
hone our new skills. Theory must be forged by practice to really become part of
us. Theory forged by practice can also transcend mere theory by giving us concrete use 
cases and potentially new insights that expand the original theory thus leading
us to innovation.

Continuous self improvement for software developers emphasizes the need for
ongoing learning. To me the Latin phrase [non scholae sed vitae discimus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_scholae,_sed_vitae_discimus),
roughly translated as "not for school but for life we learn", embodies a good
learning philosophy because knowledge will make our lives better and allows us to progress. 

But learning must not stop at school or university, must not stop at what I might term "Big Bang"
learning, when we were able to focus most of our energy on the acquisition of
knowledge. Every day we must strive to make our software development and every
aspect of our lives a little better by seeking out relevant knowledge and applying
it to the problems at hand to really drive home the lessons learned.
