Instead of using Scala, my focus over the last two years has been Hadoop with Java API and learning
Python. I took [Martin Odersky's Functional Programming in Scala class from Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun) in 2012
but it was time for a refresher. So together with 
[Dean Wampler and Alex Payne's Programming Scala 2nd Edition Early Access from O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033073.do) 
I embarked on a refresher/expander tour. Still a great class! 

Also trying to capture some of my Scala lessons in [my Scala sampler git project](https://github.com/medale/scala-sampler) 
as I am exploring more of the Scala ecosystem. The main drivers for learning more about Scala this time 
around are [Scalding](http://www.cascading.org/projects/scalding/) and [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). 
Very much looking forward to the Spark Tutorial at the [Strata/Hadoop World 2014 NYC](http://strataconf.com/stratany2014/)!
