With the recent release of the [Scala IDE 4.3](http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html)
it was time to download and upgrade my Ubuntu development environment. Long time
ago, I could just run the Scala (or Eclipse) IDE from the command line (./eclipse) 
and then right-click the ? icon in the unity launcher and "Lock to Launcher".

Sometime in 2011, an Ubuntu upgrade forced a [different approach](http://askubuntu.com/questions/80013/how-to-pin-eclipse-to-the-unity-launcher) because using this default method,
the Eclipse menu items were not visible. This seems to have been fixed but I
still like my Eclipse menu on top of the Eclipse window rather than on the 
very top of the screen:

So I still use the following incantation in ~/.local/share/applications/scala-ide.desktop:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Name=Scala SDK 4.3 
Exec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= /usr/local/scala-sdk-4.3/eclipse
Terminal=false
Icon=/usr/local/scala-sdk-4.3/icon.xpm
Type=Application
Categories=IDE;Development
X-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=NewWindow
[NewWindow Shortcut Group]
Name=New Window
Exec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= /usr/local/scala-sdk-4.3/eclipse
TargetEnvironment=Unity
```

Then open with Nautilus and drag the Scala IDE icon to the launch panel:

```bash
nautilus ~/.local/share/applications
```

And then:
