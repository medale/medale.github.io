In February 2014 I was approached by UMBC Training to see if I were interested in creating a Hadoop 2-based Hadoop
for Developers class. I was a bit conflicted about the time commitment and relatively short timeline (teach first
class by the end of June) for an extracurricular effort in addition to full-time employment. But I decided to take
the challenge and develop a course that I would have enjoyed.

There is nothing like creating a course and teaching to really get a deeper all-around understanding of a subject area.
Using [Tom White's excellent Hadoop:The Definitive Guide](http://www.amazon.com/Hadoop-Definitive-Guide-Tom-White/dp/1449311520/) 
and [Alex Holmes' Hadoop in Action (2nd edition MEAP)](http://www.amazon.com/Hadoop-Practice-Alex-Holmes/dp/1617292222)
I developed the course materials using the [Enron email dataset from CMU](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/) to create
examples and labs for all the available Hadoop features. Stored the original emails in an Avro container file.

Now that the course is done and taught (with very nice feedback!) it is back to irregularly scheduled continuous self-improvement!
For now, on to Apache Spark, Java 8, Eclipse Luna, catching up on Communications of ACM reading and generally keeping up with 
the quickly evolving big data ecosystem.
