[O'Reilly's Strata/Hadoop World NYC 2013 Conference](http://strataconf.com/stratany2013/), just like its
2012 predecessor, was a great learning and networking opportunity. Again, the conference was sold
out and, due to its popularity, will move to the more spacious [glass-enclosed NYC Javits conference center](http://www.javitscenter.com/)
for its 2014 offering. 

The conference speaker and attendees lists read like a Who's Who in the Hadoop ecosystem. Here are the [full schedule and slides
for the talks are available](http://strataconf.com/stratany2013/public/schedule/full/public) from the conference web site.

With the Hadoop 2.2.0 release going GA, big launches included Cloudera's CDH5 bundle. The new YARN resource management
framework is a game changer. It eliminates a scalability bottleneck but, even more importantly, it allows other processing 
paradigms to knowingly co-exist within the same Hadoop cluster and share resources. Current examples include project like:

* [HBase on Yarn - Hoya](https://github.com/hortonworks/hoya/)
* [Storm on Yarn](https://github.com/yahoo/storm-yarn)
* [Spark on Yarn](http://spark.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-yarn.html)

With the vendor area size increasing almost 4-fold, clearly there are a lot of excitement and innovation around the Hadoop
ecosystem and Big Data. Looking forward to learning more about all the offerings!
