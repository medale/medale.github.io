On April 22nd, 2015, I had the privilege of giving a presentation on
"Adding Spark to Your Hadoop" to the [Baltimore Hadoop User Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Hadoop-User-Group/events/221583743/)
at the wonderful AOL spaces on McDonnell Street at Brewers Hill. Many thanks to
Don and Brendan for organizing the meetup and Paris for hosting! Thank you to
all the attendees!

The presentation is [now available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgqYn3RlWlI).

The slides for the presentation are under the
[Spark Mail GitHub Repository](https://github.com/medale/) under [presentation/AddSparkToYourHadoop.pdf](https://github.com/medale/spark-mail/blob/master/presentation/AddSparkToYourHadoop.pdf).

Instructions and the Dockerfile/scripts on how to obtain the Spark Mail
Docker image used for the demo are [here](https://github.com/medale/spark-mail-docker).
