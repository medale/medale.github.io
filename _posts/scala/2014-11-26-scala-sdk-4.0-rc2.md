I have been running on [Scala SDK 4.0 RC1 for a while now](/scala/2014/10/26/scala-sdk-4.0-rc1/) and it has been
very solid. Support for 2.10 and 2.11 projects in the same IDE is great. Looks
like the [Ticket Tracking reflects that](https://scala-ide-portfolio.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/support/tickets).

Thank you for a great IDE!
