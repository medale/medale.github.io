# Northern Virginia MEDLIFE chapter - Computer Science presentation

The [MEDLIFE NoVA high school chapter](https://medlifenova.org/) (Medicine, education, and development for low income families everywhere)
provided virtual presentations on different career fields. MEDLIFE NoVA asked me to target a presentation on Computer Science to a 6th grade level.
That felt a lot more challenging than the more technical presentations that I normally give. Computer Science is such a broad field that it was hard to do it justice in
45 minutes with questions. And there were some great questions after the talk...
