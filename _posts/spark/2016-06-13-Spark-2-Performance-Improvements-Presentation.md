On June 13th I was fortunate to present the latest Apache Spark - Project Tungsten updates, which further improve Spark performance through whole-stage code generation and vectorization.

See presentation at my github repo at [SparkPerformance.pdf](https://github.com/medale/presentations/blob/master/spark-performance-2.0-2016-06/SparkPerformance.pdf). The src directory of that repo also contains the corresponding example files.
